Comment from <a href="http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Crack_prevention">iPhone Dev Wiki
Crack Prevention</a>:
App Store binaries are signed by both their developer and Apple. This encrypts the binary so
that decryption keys are needed in order to make the binary readable. When iOS executes the
binary, the decryption keys are used to decrypt the binary into a readable state where it is
then loaded into memory and executed. iOS can tell the encryption status of a binary via the
cryptid structure member of LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO MachO load command. If cryptid is a non-zero
value then the binary is encrypted.

'Cracking' works by letting the kernel decrypt the binary then siphoning the decrypted data into
a new binary file, resigning, and repackaging. This will only work on jailbroken devices as
codesignature validation has been removed. Resigning takes place because while the codesignature
doesn't have to be valid thanks to the jailbreak, it does have to be in place unless you have
AppSync or similar to disable codesignature checks.
